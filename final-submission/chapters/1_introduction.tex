\label{sec:introduction}

\section{Motivation}
% Rough introduction of the topic. Details are covered in Chapter "Background"
In this chapter, we legitimate this work and explain the value and applicability of our proposed solution.

\subsection{Present situation}
% What (free) backup solutions exist and why do we need another one?
% Has someone else published the same idea before?
With the ongoing fast digitisation, the demand for reliable and easy-to-use backup solutions is growing fast. Not only small companies have a high dependency on the safety of digital resources, but also most individuals depend on large sets of digital documents and other data.

Today, most individuals and small companies have limited choice with regards to data backup storage.

\paragraph{Various cloud providers} offer many users high quantities of comfortable, easy to use backup storage. In most cases, this solutions post either a encrypted or unencrypted copies of all data into a public cloud environment using a custom application.

\paragraph{Local backup solutions,} for instance local hard disk drives or network attached storage systems (NAS) offer a high level of data privacy. 

Existing software solutions, for instance Borg Backup\footnote{\url{https://www.borgbackup.org/}}, rdedup\footnote{\url{https://github.com/dpc/rdedup}} or custom implementations with rsync and ceph\footnote{\url{https://ceph.com/}} allow for safe, deduplicated backups.

An example for a common backup solution that comes bundled with a storage medium is the Apple Time Machine\footnote{\url{https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht201250}}.


\subsection{Problem}
% What problem do we solve with our proposal? / Why do we write this concept? New idea?
% Which problems have we found / are common for this topic?
The backup solutions described in the previous section come with several liabilities.

\paragraph{Cloud backup storage} requires a high level of trust in a third party provider. It is not evident, what level of data security and availability a user is provided with.

Furthermore, such solutions may raise privacy concerns or even legal issues, as data is not kept safely on premises but in a data center, possibly in another legal domain.

\paragraph{Local backup solutions} require a high level of personal maintenance, e.g. by managing and exchanging hard disk drives.

Another problem that is often encountered are missing backup copies. For instance, backups are only stored on a hard disk drive in one location - which might lead to data loss, e.g. in case of a fire.

Most of these solutions are non-trivial to set up and require a high level of knowledge to operate.

Secondly, most of these solutions create backups directly to a writeable storage medium from the client computer and do not prevent data loss in case of malware infections~\cite{young-cryptovirology}.

\subsection{Solution}

The problems listed in the previous sections should be solved by a fast, easy to use, and secure backup system. The system should combine privacy benefits of local backups with automated data distribution, to provide high safety guarantees.

The main target user of such a system are individuals (e.g. families) and small companies.
