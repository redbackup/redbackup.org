\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\section{Motivation}
% Rough introduction of the topic. Details are covered in Chapter "Background"
In this section, we legitimate this work and explain the value and applicability of our proposed solution.

\subsection{Present situation}
% What (free) backup solutions exist and why do we need another one?
% Has someone else published the same idea before?
With the ongoing fast digitisation, the demand for reliable and easy-to-use backup solutions is growing fast. Not only enterprises, but also individuals take a great interest in securing their digital artefacts.

Today, most individuals and small enterprises have limited choice with regards to data backup storage.

\paragraph{Cloud backup storage} offers many users high quantities of comfortable, easy to use backup storage. In most cases, these solutions post either a encrypted or unencrypted copies of data into a public cloud environment using specialised software.

Examples for such cloud backup storage providers are Dropbox\footnote{\url{https://www.dropbox.com/}} and Crashplan\footnote{\url{https://www.crashplan.com/}}.

\paragraph{Local backup solutions,} for instance external hard disk drives or network attached storage systems (NAS) offer a high level of data privacy. 

Existing software solutions, for instance Borg Backup\footnote{\url{https://www.borgbackup.org/}}, rdedup\footnote{\url{https://github.com/dpc/rdedup}} or custom implementations with rsync and ceph\footnote{\url{https://ceph.com/}} allow for safe, deduplicated backups.

An existing solution which is easy to use for the Apple Mac platform, is Apple Time Machine combined with a Apple Time Capsule\footnote{\url{https://www.apple.com/airport-time-capsule/}}.


\subsection{Problem}
% What problem do we solve with our proposal? / Why do we write this concept? New idea?
% Which problems have we found / are common for this topic?
The backup solutions described in the previous section come with several repercussions.

\paragraph{Cloud backup storage} requires a high level of trust in a third party provider. It is not evident, what level of data security and availability a user is provided with.

Furthermore, such solutions may raise privacy concerns or even legal issues, as data is not kept safely on premises but in a data centre, possibly in another legal domain.

\paragraph{Local backup solutions} require considerable administration effort, e.g. by managing and exchanging hard disk drives.

Another problem that is often encountered is missing backup copies. For instance, backups are only stored on a hard disk drive in one location - which might lead to data loss, e.g. in case of a fire.

Safe and reliable solutions are non-trivial to set up and require a high level of knowledge to operate.

Secondly, most of these solutions create backups directly to a writeable storage medium from the client computer and do not prevent data loss in case of ransomware infections~\cite{young-cryptovirology}.

\subsection{Solution}

The problems listed in the previous sections should be solved by a fast, easy to use, and secure backup system. Such a system should combine privacy benefits of local backups with automated data distribution, to provide high safety guarantees.

The target users of such a system are individuals (e.g. families) and small enterprises.

\section{Goals and Tasks}
% TODO: Rephrase, this paragraph was copied from https://eprints.hsr.ch/523/1/Data%20over%20DAB.pdf !
This section presents the revised goals and provides a rationale for the deviations from the original goals.

\subsection{Initial Goals}
The initial goals of this study project where specified by us in cooperation with Prof.~Farhad~Mehta in the \nameref{sec:task-description}.

\subsection{Revised Goals}
This section lists the revised goals that were specified during the beginning of the project. All deviations from the \nameref{sec:task-description} are noted in the following Chapter \fullref{sec:deviations-from-original-goals}.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Elaboration of following issues in a theoretical concept and architecture:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item joining of nodes
            \item planned and unplanned leaving of nodes
            \item distribution of data within the network
            \item uploading data into the distributed system
            \item addressing within the distributed system
            \item retrieving stored data
            \item scalability for up to several 100 nodes where every node can store a data volume of up to 2 terabytes.
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Evaluation of an appropriate implementation language for the prototype
    \item Implementation of a prototype, demonstrating the core features as specified in the concept paper.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Deviations from the Original Goals}\label{sec:deviations-from-original-goals}

\subsubsection{Degree of Redundancy}
While researching data redundancy strategies, we realised that the full specification of \gls{client-m-replication} is not a feasible goal during the study project. The reason for this is its complexity and the limited time of the study project, as discussed in Chapter \fullref{sec:fundamental-design-decisions}.

\subsubsection{Simplifications for Prototype}
Due to time constrains of the study project, it was not possible to implement the full specified architecture in the prototype. Hence, we decided to implement the core backup, restore and distribution mechanisms, to prove that the concept works.

Simplifications for the prototype are discussed in Chapter~\fullref{sec:our-approach}.
