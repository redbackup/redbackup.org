\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\section{Motivation}
% Rough introduction of the topic. Details are covered in Chapter "Background"
In this section, we legitimate this work and explain the value and applicability of our proposed solution.

\subsection{Present situation}
% What (free) backup solutions exist and why do we need another one?
% Has someone else published the same idea before?
With the ongoing fast digitisation, the demand for reliable and easy-to-use backup solutions is growing fast. Not only companies, but also individuals take a great interest in securing their digital artefacts.

Today, most individuals and small companies have limited choice with regards to data backup storage.

\paragraph{Cloud backup storage} offers many users high quantities of comfortable, easy to use backup storage. In most cases, these solutions post either a encrypted or unencrypted copies of data into a public cloud environment using specialised software.

Examples for such cloud backup storage providers are Dropbox\footnote{\url{https://www.dropbox.com/}} and Crashplan\footnote{\url{https://www.crashplan.com/}}.

\paragraph{Local backup solutions,} for instance external hard disk drives or network attached storage systems (NAS) offer a high level of data privacy. 

Existing software solutions, for instance Borg Backup\footnote{\url{https://www.borgbackup.org/}}, rdedup\footnote{\url{https://github.com/dpc/rdedup}} or custom implementations with rsync and ceph\footnote{\url{https://ceph.com/}} allow for safe, deduplicated backups.

An existing solution which is easy to use for the Apple Mac platform, is Apple Time Machine combined with a Apple Time Capsule\footnote{\url{https://www.apple.com/airport-time-capsule/}}.


\subsection{Problem}
% What problem do we solve with our proposal? / Why do we write this concept? New idea?
% Which problems have we found / are common for this topic?
The backup solutions described in the previous section come with several repercussions.

\paragraph{Cloud backup storage} requires a high level of trust in a third party provider. It is not evident, what level of data security and availability a user is provided with.

Furthermore, such solutions may raise privacy concerns or even legal issues, as data is not kept safely on premises but in a data centre, possibly in another legal domain.

\paragraph{Local backup solutions} require considerable administration effort, e.g. by managing and exchanging hard disk drives.

Another problem that is often encountered is missing backup copies. For instance, backups are only stored on a hard disk drive in one location - which might lead to data loss, e.g. in case of a fire.

Safe and reliable solutions are non-trivial to set up and require a high level of knowledge to operate.

Secondly, most of these solutions create backups directly to a writeable storage medium from the client computer and do not prevent data loss in case of ransomware infections~\cite{young-cryptovirology}.

\subsection{Solution}

The problems listed in the previous sections should be solved by a fast, easy to use, and secure backup system. Such a system should combine privacy benefits of local backups with automated data distribution, to provide high safety guarantees.

The target users of such a system are individuals (e.g. families) and small companies.
