\section{Requirements}

The System knows two roles: \emph{Users} and \emph{Administrators}.

A typical \emph{User} does not want to interact with the system at any time.
All he/she wants is to be sure that all his/her data is safely backed
up.

An \emph{Administrator} wants to interact with the system as less as possible.
He wants to be sure that the system runs smoothly. If something goes
wrong, he wants to be able to fix it within a few minutes.


The requirements are defined in the following sections in the form of user stories.
Not all requirements must be met within the study project but the might %TODO: Reference to scope section as soon as ready.
impact architectural decisions. Relevant Requirements are therefore listed here \relevantreq{emphasised}.

\subsection{Requirements of a User}
As a user, \ldots{}

\begin{flushright}
on the topic of \textbf{backup creation}, \ldots{}
\end{flushright}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item	I want my backups to take place automatically, silently and continuously so I do not forget.
	\item	I want to get notified if the creation of a backup fails, but not for every little trivia.
	\item	I want to get notified if I have not created a new backup for a suspicious amount of time (e.g. usually daily but suddenly no backups for a week).
	\item	I want that the creation of a backup does not impact the performance of my device noticeably (CPU, RAM, network etc).
	\item	I want to be able to stop/restart/suspend my device at any time even if a new backup is in the process of being created.
	\item	I want to exclude certain files from being backed up, for example, downloads.
	\enumcountsave
\end{enumerate}

\begin{flushright}
on the topic of \textbf{backup storage}, \ldots{}
\end{flushright}

\begin{enumerate}
	\enumcountrestore
	\item	I want my backup data to be encrypted so that only I can restore it.
	\item	I want to create backups from everywhere (especially not just from home).
	\item   \relevantreq{I want my backup data to be stored in physical sites that I trust.}
	\item	\relevantreq{I want my backups to be space efficient to safe cost.}
	\item	\relevantreq{I want my data to be stored with a defined degree of redundancy so that it does not get lost.}
	\item	\relevantreq{I want my data to be replicated to different places (e.g. buildings) in case one of them is subject to a catastrophic event (e.g. an earthquake, fire).}
	\item	\relevantreq{I want that my data is intact, safe and secure at any time.}
	\item	\relevantreq{I does not matter, where my data is replicated to within my trusted network as long as it stays safe.}
	\item	\relevantreq{I don't care where within the trusted network my data is backed up to as long as the creation and restore of backups is not significantly slower.}
	\item	\relevantreq{I want to create backups quickly. The acceptable duration depends on the amount of new and modified data.}
	\item	\relevantreq{I want to define how long backups are stored or use a reasonable default.}

	\enumcountsave
\end{enumerate}

\begin{flushright}
on the topic of \textbf{backup restore}, \ldots{}
\end{flushright}

\begin{enumerate}
	\enumcountrestore
	\item	\relevantreq{I want to be able to restore my data as easily as possible in case of a catastrophic event.}
	\item	\relevantreq{I want to be able to restore a previous version of a (possibly deleted) file within less than five minutes.}
	\item	I want to see the progress when I restore data so that I can estimate when it is done.
	\enumcountsave
\end{enumerate}

\begin{flushright}
on the topic of the \textbf{backup software}, \ldots{}
\end{flushright}

\begin{enumerate}
	\enumcountrestore
	\item	I want the backup software to use as less space on the disk as possible because I want to use it for my data.
	\item	I want be able to install and have the software up and running within five minutes.
	\item	I don't want to perform updates manually.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Requirements an Administrator}

As an administrator, \ldots{}

\begin{flushright}
on the topic of \textbf{backup system management}, \ldots{}
\end{flushright}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \relevantreq{I want to grant new users access to the backup system.}
	\item \relevantreq{I want be able to see how much capacity a user is using.}
	\item \relevantreq{I want to limit the capacity per user.}
	\item I want to define default profiles on how long to keep backups for new users.
	\item \relevantreq{I want to extend the storage capacity by plugging in a new disk and starting/connecting a new node.}
	\item \relevantreq{I want to add new backup sites (and therefore nodes) to the system.}
	\item \relevantreq{I want to scale the system up to 100 Nodes and down to 2.}
	\item \relevantreq{I want to put large disks (e.g. 2TB) into a node so that I do not have to maintain an unjustifiably high number of nodes.}
	\item \relevantreq{I want the system to operate properly if the management node is down (no single point of failure). The addition of new nodes may not be possible without management.}
	\item \relevantreq{I want to perform updates including reboots without impacting the performance of the network.}
	\item \relevantreq{I want to update the management server (including restart) without impacting the system (except for the configuration/monitoring part).}
	\enumcountsave
\end{enumerate}

\begin{flushright}
on the topic of \textbf{backup monitoring}, \ldots{}
\end{flushright}

\begin{enumerate}
	\enumcountrestore
	\item \relevantreq{I want to receive notifications quickly (i.e. within an hour) when a disk or node in the System fails.}
	\item \relevantreq{I want to receive notifications within an hour if a disk or node might fail soon (e.g. SMART-results indicate that a disk will fail).}
	\item \relevantreq{I want to be informed if a certain replication-degree cannot be met.}
\end{enumerate}
