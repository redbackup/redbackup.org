\section{Requirements}

The System knows two roles: \emph{Users} and \emph{Administrators}.

A typical \emph{User} does not want to interact with the system at any time.
All he/she wants is to be sure that all his/her data is safely backed
up.

An \emph{Administrator} wants to interact with the system as less as possible.
He wants to be sure that the system runs smoothly. If something goes
wrong, he wants to be able to fix it within a few minutes.


The requirements are defined in the following sections in the form of user stories.
Not all requirements must be met within the study project but the might %TODO: Reference to scope section as soon as ready.
impact architectural decisions. Relevant Requirements are therefore listed here \relevantreq{emphasised}.

\subsection{Requirements of a User}
As a user, \ldots{}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item   I want my backup data to be stored in physical sites that I trust.
	\item	I want my backup data to be encrypted so that only I can restore it.
	\item	I want my backups to take place automatically, silently and continuously so that I won't forget it
	\item	I want that the creation of a backup does not impact the performance of my device noticeably (CPU, RAM, network etc).
	\item	I want to be able to stop/restart/suspend my device at any time even if a new backup is in the process of being created.
	\item	I want the backup software to use as less space on the disk as possible because I want to use it for my data.
	\item \relevantreq{I want to be able to restore a deleted file within less than five minutes.}
	\item	\relevantreq{I want to be able to restore a previous version of a file within less than five minutes.}
	\item	I want to see the progress when I restore data so that I can estimate when it is done.
	\item	I want be able to install and have the software up and running within five minutes.
	\item	I want to exclude certain files from being backed up, for example, downloads.
	\item	\relevantreq{I want to pay as less as possible for the storage of my data.}
	\item	\relevantreq{I don't care where my data is backed up to as long my backup is safe and the creation and restore of backups is not significantly slower.}
	\item	\relevantreq{I want to create backups of quickly. The acceptable duration depends on the amount of new and modified data.}
	\item	\relevantreq{I want my backups to be space efficient to safe cost.}
	\item	I want to get notified if the creation of a backup fails.
	\item	I want to get notified if I have not created a new backup for a suspicious amount of time (e.g. usually daily but suddenly no backups for a week).
	\item	I want to create backups from everywhere (especially not just from home).
	\item	I don't want to perform updates manually.
	\item	\relevantreq{I want to define how long backups are stored or use a reasonable default.}
	\item	\relevantreq{I want my data to be stored with a defined degree of redundancy so that it does not get lost.}
	\item	\relevantreq{I does not matter, where my data is replicated to within my trusted network as long as it stays safe.}
	\item	\relevantreq{I want my data to be replicated to different places (e.g. buildings) in case one of them is subject to a catastrophic event (e.g. an earthquake, fire).}
	\item	\relevantreq{I want to be able to restore my data in case of a catastrophic event.}
	\item	\relevantreq{I want that my data is intact, safe and secure at any time.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Requirements an Administrator}

As an administrator, \ldots{}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \relevantreq{I want to receive notifications quickly when a Disk or Node in the System fails.}
	\item \relevantreq{I want to receive notifications within an hour if a Disk or Node might fail soon (e.g. SMART-Results indicate that a Disk will fail).}
	\item \relevantreq{I want to extend the storage capacity by plugging in a new Disk and starting/connecting a new node.}
	\item \relevantreq{I want to perform updates including reboots without impacting the performance of the System (e.g. if data must be copied around).}
	\item \relevantreq{I want to be informed if a certain replication-degree cannot be met.}
	\item \relevantreq{I want to scale the system up to 100 Nodes and down to 2.}
	\item \relevantreq{I want to put large disks (e.g. 2TB) into a node so that I do not have to maintain an unjustifiably high number of nodes.}
	\item \relevantreq{I want to grant new users access to the backup system.}
	\item \relevantreq{I want to add new nodes to the system.}
	\item \relevantreq{I want be able to see how much capacity a user is using.}
	\item \relevantreq{I want to limit the capacity per user.}
	\item I want to define default profiles on how long to keep backups for new users.
	\item \relevantreq{I want to update the management server (including restart) without impacting the system (except for the configuration/monitoring part).}
	\item \relevantreq{I want the system to operate properly if the management node is down (no single point of failure). The addition of new nodes may not be possible without management.}
\end{enumerate}
