\chapter{Requirements}

The System knows two roles: Users and Administrators.

A typical user does not want to interact with the system at any time.
All he/she wants is to be sure that all his/her data is safely backed
up.

An Administrator wants to interact with the system as less as possible.
He wants to be sure that the system runs smoothly. If something goes
wrong, he wants to be able to fix it within a few minutes.


The requirements are defined in the following sections in the form of user stories.
Not all requirements must be met within the study project but the might
impact architectural decisions and are therefore listed here.

\section{Requirements of a User}
As a user, \ldots{}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	I want my backup data to be encrypted so that only I can restore it.
	\item
	I want my backups to take place automatically, silently and
	continuously so that I won't forget it
	\item
	I want that the creation of a backup does not impact the performance
	of my device noticeably (CPU, RAM, Network etc)
	\item
	I want to be able to stop/restart/suspend my device at any time even
	if a new backup is in the process of being created.
	\item
	I want the backup software to use as less space on the disk as
	possible because I want to use it for my data.
	\item
	I want to be able to restore a deleted file within less than five
	minutes.
	\item
	I want to be able to restore a previous version of a file within less
	than five minutes.
	\item
	I want to see the progress when I restore data so that I can estimate
	when it is done.
	\item
	I want to install and use the software within one minute.
	\item
	I want to exclude certain files from being backed up, for example,
	downloads.
	\item
	I want to pay as less as possible for the storage of my data
	\item
	I don't care where my data is backed up to as long the creation and
	restore of backups is not significantly slower.
	\item
	I want to create backups of quickly. The acceptable duration depends
	on the amount of new and modified data.
	\item
	I want my backups to be space efficient to safe cost.
	\item
	I want to get notified if the creation of a backup fails
	\item
	I want to get notified if I have not created a new backup for a
	suspicious amount of time (e.g. usually daily but suddenly no backups
	for a week)
	\item
	I want to create backups from everywhere (especially not just from
	home)
	\item
	I don't want to perform updates manually.
	\item
	I want to define how long backups are stored or use a reasonable
	default.
	\item
	I want my data to be stored with a defined degree of redundancy so
	that it does not get lost
	\item
	I don't know or want to know where my data is replicated to as long as
	it stays safe.
	\item
	I want my data to be replicated to different buildings in case one of
	them is subject to a catastrophic event (e.g. an earthquake).
	\item
	I want that my data is intact, safe and secure.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Requirements an Administrator}

As an administrator, \ldots{}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	I want to receive notifications immediately when a Disk or Node in the
	System fails
	\item
	I want to receive notifications within an hour if a Disk or Node might
	fail soon (e.g. SMART-Results indicate that a Disk will fail)
	\item
	I want to extend the storage capacity by plugging in a new Disk and
	starting a new server.
	\item
	I want to perform updates including reboots without impacting the
	performance of the System (e.g. if data must be copied around)
	\item
	I want to be informed if a certain replication-degree cannot be met.
	\item
	I want to scale the system up to 100 Nodes and down to 2.
	\item
	I want to put large disks into a node so that I do not have to
	maintain an unjustifiably high number of nodes.
	\item
	I want to grant new users access to the backup system.
	\item
	I want to add new nodes to the system.
	\item
	I want to limit the capacity per user
	\item
	I want to define default profiles on how long to keep backups for new
	users.
	\item
	I want to update the management node (including restart) without
	impacting the system (except for the configuration part)
	\item
	I want the system to operate properly if the management node is down
	(no single point of failure).
\end{enumerate}
