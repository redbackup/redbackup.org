The project was a fascinating intellectual challenge, which allowed me to use lots of my experience and knowledge acquired while studying.

Finding an appropriate way of documenting a complex software system was one of the significant challenges for me. It was interesting to attend the lecture "Application Architecture" in parallel which focuses on this problem entirely. Unfortunately, many interesting techniques were discussed relatively late in this course by which we already finished our specification. Reading about fault tolerance and networking patterns in the lecture "Advanced Patterns and Frameworks" also strengthened my confidence in our proposed architecture because we used many of them implicitly.

I played well together with Fabian even though we worked a lot apart. We found the right balance by discussing relevant tasks in person and doing more routine and detailed work separate and more focused.

The explorative nature of the project made it hard to come up with reasonable estimates. It was the right decision to keep sprints very short to stay agile. I also learned to appreciate the value of checklists, e.g. for sprint planning and completion.
