# Developing Redbackup

## Tools

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) >= 2.0 for version control

## Writing Guidelines
In order to have a consistent style of writing, we defined the following guidelines. These guidelines apply to all documents related to the redbackup project.

- Keep it brief, clear and objective
- Write short and straightforward sentences
- Do not use synonyms for concepts etc. (always use the same wording, e.g. 'client' or 'node')
- Abbreviations must be introduced the first time they occur in the text (except well-known ones)
- Prevent ambiguity in sentences
- Use personal style ("we") whenever appropriate; usually for the description of our work.
- When a gender-specific pronoun is required, use "he/she".
- Use present tense except for the description of (our) completed work.
