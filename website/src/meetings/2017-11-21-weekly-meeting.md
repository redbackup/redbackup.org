## Discussion / Decisions

1. Presentation of the minimal prototype
    - Sadly, the demo did not work yet due to a IO-Bug
    - The demo will be made good on our next Meeting
    - A complete Presentation (max. 20 minutes) including a Demo of the SA will be carried out in the last week in as part of the regular meeting.
2. Discussion of the final submission document
    - What is the difference between the abstract and the management summary?
      - Management summary can have subtitles and is more extensive than the abstract
      - the abstract has no subtitles
    - How is the revised structure?
      - The backgrund chapter can be left out if its contents are part of the introduction
      - Otherwise, the structure looks good to MeF.
3. Bachelor Thesis
    - Discussion of what we should do as BA.
    - We will meet MeF by no later than Monday (27.11.2017) with our final decision on what to do:
      - Project at Dividat (OCaml)
      - "Schleifmaschienen" Project from ETH
      - Learning tools for the Lambda Calculus and related problems
      - Project with another Advisor.
    - MeF is in the Room 1.267 from 10:10 - 11:50 as well as from 13:10 - 16:50
4. Date and time for next meeting
    - We forgot to fix the date for our next meeting. We will fix another date when meeting with MeF as part of the BA discussion.
