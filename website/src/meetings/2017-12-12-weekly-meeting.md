    - We will show a full demo including replication on the study project review.
2. Discuss abstract
    - MeF remarked the follwing:
      - Invest more time because this is the part that is read the most
      - Rewrite the first sentence: do not mention the prototype and focus on the problem that  we solve.
      - Too many commas
      - The structure of the abstract is good
      - Do not add more information
      - We can reuse the finalized abstract for the poster
