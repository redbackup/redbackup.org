## Attendees

* Raphael Zimmermann, rzimmerm
* Prof. Dr. Farhad Mehta, MeF

## Agenda

- Finalization of Task description
- Project Management:
    - Questions regarding role MeF and project information page https://wiki.hsr.ch/FarhadMehta/wiki.cgi?ProjectInformation
        - See https://www.redbackup.org 
        - No Passwords are required due to public read-only access to the Issue Tracker / CI / Source Repository.
    - Discuss rough project plan with Milestones
- Language evaluation:
    - We did not have the time to learn Rust and Erlang during the summer. To create a prototype in both languages will be too much work from our point of view. We must also discuss the (missing) tooling in both ecosystem (Code Coverage, Metrics etc.)
- Infrastructure
    - Demonstration of Project infrastructure (Redmine, Git, CI).
    - How should we log time for Infrastructure setup since it is not exclusively for the SA (BA as well)?
    - Discuss access to Project calendar
- Documentation:
    - Are there any requirements for the document layout (HSR CI).
    - We are not sure what the following paragraph from the [Project Information Page](https://wiki.hsr.ch/FarhadMehta/wiki.cgi?ProjectInformation) implies: "All submissions must conform to the relevant regulations of the Computer Science Department at HSR."
