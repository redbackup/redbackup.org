1. Review revised documents
2. Presentation of the minimal prototype
3. Bachelor Thesis
4. Date and time for next meeting

## Discussion / Decisions

1. Review revised documents
    - We thank MeF for the review!
    - General feedback from MeF:
        - Seems fine
        - The specification is too long and must be must be more concise. The chord paper for example is not that long but describes a very complex system.
        - We will write a more concise description of the system in the final submission document and keep the appendix as.
    - Requirements
      - Additionally to the intentions, write down the most important requirements (concise, 10-15 items).
    - What do the annotations in Figure 1 and 3 mean?
      - It was unclear at the time of ready, that "storage" is a component itself and not a medium.
      - We will clarify this when we write the concise system description in the final submission document.
2. Presentation of the minimal prototype
    - The prototype seems fine so far.
    - We discussed the used frameworks Diesel and Tokio.
3. Bachelor Thesis
    - For MeF, the product of the thesis must be "in use" for a 6.
    - redbackup is an option, if..
        - it is a working open source project (with downloads!)
        - we find an industry partner, that uses it.
    - MeFs project ideas:
        - Low energy devices (power can turn off at every moment)
        - A "map" of a Git repository for real insights (who contributed which code, filter, hot spots, ...)
        - Lambda calculus interpreter: Requires a really good user interface
        - DAB+ monitoring (lots of signal processing)
        - Light measurement with drones
        - "Dance platform" for the elderly
            - Lots of OCAML code
            - Improve tooling and code
                - testing, documentation generation and much more
    - We will discuss how to proceed on our next meeting.
