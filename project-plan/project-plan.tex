\section{Project Overview}
The goal of the Study Project is to provide a theoretical description of an append-only, distributed peer-to-peer data storage as well as a working prototype as described in the problem statement \cite{problemstatement}.

The project setting, vision, goals, as well as all other project boundaries, are described in depth in the problem statement \cite{problemstatement}.

\section{Project Organization}

The project has a flat structure. All team members have the same strategic rights and duties. Prof. Dr Farhad Mehta is the project supervisor and is therefore superior in the organigram.
