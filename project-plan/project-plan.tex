\section{Project Overview}
The goal of the Study Project is to provide a theoretical description of an append-only, distributed peer-to-peer data storage as well as a working prototype as described in the problem statement \cite{problemstatement}.

The project setting, vision, goals, as well as all other project boundaries, are described in depth in the problem statement \cite{problemstatement}.

\section{Risk Management}

An assessment of our specific project risks is visible in Table \ref{tbl:project-risks}. To account for these risks, we reduce our weekly sprint time by the total weighted risk applicable to the planned task topics (on average approximately 20\%).

		\hline
		\# & Title & Description & Prevention / Reaction & Risk [h] & Probab. & = [h] \\ \hline

		%Infrastructure
		1 & Problems with project infrastructure
		  & The used project infrastructure is not or only partially available, or data loss occurs within management software
		  & Clean tool setup, self hosting of tools to prevent third-party dependencies
		  & 30 & 30\% & 9 \\

		%Planning
		2 & Communication errors
		  & Errors due to miscommunication or misapprehension
		  & Maintain a high level of interaction, clear specification of tasks responsibilities, conduct meetings if ambiguities exist
		  & 10 & 40\% & 4\\

		3 & Scope creep
		  & The project's scope is extended over the project course
		  & Clear definition of the project scope and limitations. Discuss changes with supervisor.
		  & 30 & 30\% & 9\\

		%Paper / Architecture
		4 & Architecture does not scale
		  & The chosen architecture does not scale to the expected data volume or node size
		  & Invest more time in architecture design
		  & 30 & 40\% & 12\\

		5 & Missing architecture aspects
		  & The architecture-whitepaper does not cover certain aspects necessary concepts of the prototype
		  & Invest more time in architecture design
		  & 15 & 60\% & 9\\

		%Prototype
		6 & Problems with technology stack
		  & Parts of the selected technology stack are not well suited, incomplete or immature
		  & Reflect technology suitability during the architecture draft
		  & 60 & 60\% & 36\\

		6 & Dependency Errors
		  & There are errors/bugs in dependencies i.e. libraries.
		  & Carefully select libraries, limit dependencies to a minimum
		  & 20 & 30\% & 6\\

		7 & Missing dependency documentation
		  & Selected libraries are lacking good documentation
		  & The documentation should be a library selection criterion
		  & 15 & 40\% & 6\\

		\hline
		& Total weighted risk & & & & & 91\\
