\section{Project Overview}
The goal of the Study Project is to provide a theoretical description of an append-only, distributed peer-to-peer data storage as well as a working prototype as described in the problem statement \cite{problemstatement}.

The project setting, vision, goals, as well as all other project boundaries, are described in depth in the problem statement \cite{problemstatement}.

\section{Risk Management}
An assessment of our specific project risks is visible in Table \ref{tbl:project-risks}.

	\begin{tabu}{r l X X r r}
		\hline
		\# & Title & Description & Prevention / Reaction & Risk[h] & Probab. \\ \hline
		
		%Infrastructure
		1 & Problems with project infrastructure
		  & The used project infrastructure is not or only partially available. Data loss within management software.
		  & Clean tool setup, self hosting of tools to prevent third-party dependencies
		  & 30 & 30\% \\
		
		%Planning
		2 & Communication errors
		  & Errors due to miscommunication or misapprehension
		  & Maintain a high level of interaction, clear specification of tasks responsibilities, conduct meeting if ambiguities
		  & 10 & 40\% \\

		3 & Scope creep
		  & The project's scope is extended over the project course
		  & Clear and tought trough definition of the project scope and limitations. Discuss changes with supervisor.
		  & 30 & 30\% \\
		
		%Paper / Architecture
		4 & Architecture does not scale
		  & The choosen architecture does not scale to the expected data volume or node size
		  & Invest more time in architecture design
		  & 30 & 40\% \\

		5 & Missing architecture aspects
		  & The architecture-whitepaper does not cover certain aspects necessary concepts of the prototype
		  & Invest more time in architecture design
		  & 15 & 60\% \\
		
		%Prototype
		6 & Dependency Errors
		  & There are errors/bugs in dependencies i.e. libraries.
		  & Carefully select libraries, limit libraries to minimum
		  & 20 & 30\% \\

		7 & Missing dependency documentation
		  & Selected libraries are lacking good documentation
		  & The documentation should be a library selection criterion
		  & 15 & 40\% \\
