\section{Project Overview}
The goal of the Study Project is to provide a theoretical description of an append-only, distributed peer-to-peer data storage as well as a working prototype as described in the problem statement \cite{problemstatement}.

The project setting, vision, goals, as well as all other project boundaries, are described in depth in the problem statement \cite{problemstatement}.

\subsection{Project Management and Development}

For our project management, document \& code storage and continuous integration/deployment we utilize an Atlassian stack (JIRA, BitBucket, Bamboo, Crowd)\cite{atlassian-opensource}.

These applications are hosted on the HSR project server \textit{sinv-56017.edu.hsr.ch}, which runs a standard Ubuntu Linux 17.04.

The project documents are written in LaTeX and versioned with git.

\subsubsection{Development Tools}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Git $\geq 2.0$, \url{https://git-scm.com/}
	\item to be defined. %TODO: Add project tools when the programming language is defined
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Backup and Data Safety}

An incremental backup of the project server \textit{sinv-56017.edu.hsr.ch} including our project code and documentation is created on the independent system \textit{pin1262031.hsr.ch} every night.

As our documents and code are stored within a git repository, they are also available locally on all development systems.
