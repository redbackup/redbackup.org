\section{Project Overview}
The goal of the Study Project is to provide a theoretical description of an append-only, distributed peer-to-peer data storage as well as a working prototype as described in the problem statement \cite{problemstatement}.

The project setting, vision, goals, as well as all other project boundaries, are described in depth in the problem statement \cite{problemstatement}.

\subsection{Components}

For a better overview and to allow us a sophisticated time assessment, we decided to group tasks into categories, i.e. JIRA components. Components represent documents or products which are to be released.

Currently, tasks are separated into following components:

\begin{multicols}{2}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Final Submission Document
		\item Management
		\item Poster
		\item Presentation
		\item Project Plan
		\item Prototype
	\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\section{Project Organization}

The project has a flat structure. All team members have the same strategic rights and duties. Prof. Dr Farhad Mehta is the project advisor and is therefore superior in the organization chart as visible in Figure \ref{fig:organigram}.

\subsection{Roles}

Due to the small team size, most roles are performed by both team members.
